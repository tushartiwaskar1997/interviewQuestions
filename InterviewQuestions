Some of the interview questions I‚Äôve been asked recently:
1. If your service suddenly slows down in production, how do you find out whether the bottleneck is in the database, the network, or the JVM itself?
2. Imagine you have a Kafka consumer that‚Äôs lagging badly. How would you debug and fix it?
3. When would you use a HashMap over a ConcurrentHashMap, and what hidden issues might appear?
4. How would you design caching for a system where data changes every few seconds?
5. Can you explain how CompletableFuture actually schedules tasks under the hood?
6. What‚Äôs the tradeoff between using @Transactional at the service layer vs. at the repository layer?
7. Suppose two microservices need to stay in sync but one fails mid-request. How do you guarantee consistency?
8. How would you implement rate limiting in a distributed system?
9. What‚Äôs the difference between horizontal scaling and vertical scaling, and when would you pick one over the other?
10. If you had to optimize a query that‚Äôs suddenly scanning millions of rows, what‚Äôs your step-by-step approach?
I found these way more interesting than the usual ‚Äúexplain OOP principles‚Äù type of questions. What‚Äôs the toughest or most unexpected interview question you‚Äôve ever had?


Explain the difference between `CompletableFuture` and `FutureTask` in Java. When would you choose one over the other?
2. *Spring/Hibernate:* Describe how you would implement a read-mostly cache using Spring and Hibernate, ensuring data consistency and minimizing database load.
3. *Multithreading/AWS:* You have a Java application running in AWS that processes messages from an SQS queue. The processing is CPU-intensive. How would you design the application to maximize throughput, ensure fault tolerance, and handle scaling under heavy load? Consider multithreading and AWS services.
