Some of the interview questions I’ve been asked recently:
1. If your service suddenly slows down in production, how do you find out whether the bottleneck is in the database, the network, or the JVM itself?
2. Imagine you have a Kafka consumer that’s lagging badly. How would you debug and fix it?
3. When would you use a HashMap over a ConcurrentHashMap, and what hidden issues might appear?
4. How would you design caching for a system where data changes every few seconds?
5. Can you explain how CompletableFuture actually schedules tasks under the hood?
6. What’s the tradeoff between using @Transactional at the service layer vs. at the repository layer?
7. Suppose two microservices need to stay in sync but one fails mid-request. How do you guarantee consistency?
8. How would you implement rate limiting in a distributed system?
9. What’s the difference between horizontal scaling and vertical scaling, and when would you pick one over the other?
10. If you had to optimize a query that’s suddenly scanning millions of rows, what’s your step-by-step approach?
I found these way more interesting than the usual “explain OOP principles” type of questions. What’s the toughest or most unexpected interview question you’ve ever had?


Explain the difference between `CompletableFuture` and `FutureTask` in Java. When would you choose one over the other?
2. *Spring/Hibernate:* Describe how you would implement a read-mostly cache using Spring and Hibernate, ensuring data consistency and minimizing database load.
3. *Multithreading/AWS:* You have a Java application running in AWS that processes messages from an SQS queue. The processing is CPU-intensive. How would you design the application to maximize throughput, ensure fault tolerance, and handle scaling under heavy load? Consider multithreading and AWS services.

============================================================================================================================================

Q: Is Java pass-by-value or pass-by-reference?** 
A: Java is **pass-by-value only**. 

👉 What does that mean? 
- For **primitive types** (int, double, etc.), the actual value is passed directly. 
- For **objects**, a copy of the reference is passed (still pass-by-value). The copy points to the same object. 

👉 Why does it look like pass-by-reference? 
- Because if you change the state of the object inside the method, it reflects outside (both references point to the same object). 
- But if you reassign the reference inside the method, it won’t affect the original reference outside. 

---

**Q: Why are Comparable and Comparator interfaces required in Java?** 
A: 
- **Sorting primitives vs custom objects** 
 `Arrays.sort()` works fine for primitives, but if you try sorting an array of custom objects (like Employee), it throws `ClassCastException`. 

- **Why?** 
 Because Java doesn’t know how to compare your custom objects unless you tell it how. 

- **Solution:** 
 - `Comparable` → implement `compareTo()` to define the **natural order** of objects. 
 - `Comparator` → define custom sorting logic externally, allowing **multiple sorting strategies** for the same object type.
